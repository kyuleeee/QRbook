# QR Code Scanner and Redirect

## Overview
This project provides a QR code recognition system that scans a QR code and automatically redirects the user to the corresponding website. It is designed for seamless interaction and can be used in various applications, such as event check-ins, product information retrieval, and interactive marketing campaigns.

## Features
- **QR Code Scanning**: Detects and decodes QR codes using a camera or uploaded image.
- **Automatic Redirection**: Opens the associated URL in a web browser upon successful scan.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Can be integrated into web, mobile, or desktop applications.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for quick recognition and smooth user experience.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (for backend processing, if needed)
- Node.js (for web-based applications)
- A camera module (if using live scanning)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyuleeee/qr-code-scanner.git
cd qr-code-scanner
```

### Install Dependencies
For a Python-based implementation:
```bash
pip install opencv-python pyzbar flask
```
For a JavaScript-based implementation:
```bash
npm install qr-scanner express
```

## Usage
### Running the Web Application
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py  # If using Flask
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   node server.js  # If using Express.js
   ```
2. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).
3. Use your camera or upload an image to scan a QR code.
4. The detected URL will open automatically in a new tab.

### Running on Mobile
- If using a web-based version, host the application on a server and access it via a mobile browser.
- For a native mobile app, integrate QR scanning libraries such as `ZXing` (Android) or `AVFoundation` (iOS).
